    "# Self consistency Prompting\n",
    "Unlike other prompting techniques before, self-consistency prompting is not a single prompt. It is a technique that uses multiple prompts to generate multiple responses and then selects the most common or most relevant response from those generated responses. This technique is particularly useful for tasks where there may be multiple valid answers or where the model's output may be uncertain.\n",
