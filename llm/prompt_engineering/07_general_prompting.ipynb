    "\n",
    "- **System Prompting**: System prompting sets the overall context and purpose for the language model. It defines the ‘big picture’ of what the model should be doing, like translating a language, classifying a review etc. It defines the model’s fundamental capabilities and overarching purpose.\n",
    "- **Contextual prompting**: Contextual prompting provides specific details or background information relevant to the current conversation or task. It helps the model to understand the nuances of what’s being asked and tailor the response accordingly. It provides immediate, task-specific information to guide the response. It’s highly specific to the current task or input, which is dynamic.\n",
    "- **Role-based prompting**: Role-based prompting assigns a specific role or persona to the model. It tells the model how to behave or respond based on a particular character or perspective. This can be useful for generating responses that are more aligned with a specific tone, style, or viewpoint. It’s about defining the model’s behavior and perspective in the conversation. It frames the model’s output style and voice. It adds a layer of specificity and personality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distinguishing between system, contextual, and role prompts provides a framework for designing prompts with clear intent, allowing for flexible combinations and making it easier to analyze how each prompt type influences the language model’s output.\n",
