    "For complex tasks that require exploration or strategic lookahead, traditional or simple prompting techniques fall short. Tree of Thoughts (ToT), a framework that generalizes over chain-of-thought prompting and encourages exploration over thoughts that serve as intermediate steps for general problem solving with language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tree of Thoughts (ToT) is a framework that generalizes over chain-of-thought prompting and encourages exploration over thoughts that serve as intermediate steps for general problem solving with language models. It allows for the generation of multiple reasoning paths, enabling the model to explore different avenues of thought and arrive at more robust solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tree of Thoughts (ToT) prompting is a framework for LLM inference that allows LLMs to make an informed decision by considering and self-evaluating multiple different reasoning paths that will likely lead to an optimal solution. ToT also empowers the model to backtrack when a path is unlikely to lead to a valid solution. ToT is similar to the best-first search algorithm in Computer Science.\n",
    "\n",
    "ToT aims to mimic human's problem-solving approach. Research shows that, given a problem, humans search through a combinatorial problem space - a tree where the nodes represent partial solutions and branches represent operators that modify the nodes. They use heuristics to identify the next branch that guides them closer to the solution. The process continues till the problem concludes.\n",

      "Here's our first step:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Expert A:** My initial thought is to try to aim for a large multiplication to get us closer to 175 quickly. I'll start by considering 13 * 10. That equals 130.  We need to add 45 to that. Can we create 45 using the remaining numbers (4, 9, and 10) and the operators? It seems difficult to do directly. I'll assign a likelihood of 40% to this being a successful path, as getting to that number seems hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Expert B:** I agree that multiplication is likely needed. Let’s also think about the importance of order of operations. To reach 175, we're likely looking at a complex expression. I'm going to immediately note that we need to consider parentheses to manipulate the order.  I’ll start by looking at 13 * (4 + 9 + 10). This equals 13 * 23 = 299, which is far too high.  I'm assigning a likelihood of 30% to this path – it seems too simplistic and easy to overshoot the target.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Expert C:**  I'm going to take a slightly different approach. I'm going to consider what 175 *might* be the result of, conceptually.  175 is close to 176 (16 * 11). Maybe we can construct something that mimics that. I'm going to try combining 4 and 9 to get something close to 11. 9 + 4 = 13. Not ideal. Let's try 9 - 4 = 5. Hmm.  I’m assigning a likelihood of 25% to this path – I think I need to think about the entire expression, not just individual components.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Expert B:** Expert A is right. I need to be more flexible with my thinking. My attempt was too focused on a single operation. I also agree that it is helpful to look at the larger expression not just individual components. Lowering my likelihood to 25%.\n",

Let’s see if we can combine the numbers to create a larger base and then multiply.  How about (9 + 4) * 10 + 13? This equals 130 + 13 = 143. Still too low, but a more promising approach.  Likelihood: 40%.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Expert B:** Okay, I agree with Expert A that a more complex expression is needed. I'm going to explore a division to potentially reduce one of the numbers. Let’s try (13 + 9) / (4 / 10). This equals 22 / 0.4 = 55. Not even close. I’m going to re-evaluate this strategy as likely to be less productive. Likelihood: 10%\n",

      "**Expert C:**  I'm going to focus on creating something that multiplies to a relatively large number. I’m going to try (10 - 4) * 9 + 13. This equals 6 * 9 + 13 = 54 + 13 = 67. Still too low. I’m starting to realize I need to incorporate all numbers and operators more deliberately. Likelihood: 30%.\n",

How about (13 * (10 + 4)) / 9? This equals (13 * 14) / 9 = 182 / 9 = 20.222… That’s getting further away. Likelihood: 60%.\n",

Still too low, but I'm starting to see some patterns emerge. I'm going to try again with a different set of operations. Let's try (10 * 9) + (4 * 13) = 90 + 52 = 142. Likelihood 35%\n",
